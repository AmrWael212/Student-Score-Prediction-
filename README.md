# Student Score Prediction

This project predicts student academic performance based on various factors such as parental education level, study hours, extracurricular activities, and other demographic or lifestyle attributes.  
It uses **Python** for data processing, **Pandas/NumPy** for manipulation, **Seaborn/Matplotlib** for visualization, and **Scikit-learn** for building the prediction model.

## ðŸ“Œ Features
- Load and explore the `StudentPerformanceFactors.csv` dataset
- Perform **data cleaning** (handling missing values, duplicates, and categorical encoding)
- Visualize relationships between features and performance using **heatmaps, bar plots, and scatter plots**
- Train and evaluate a machine learning regression model for score prediction
- Provide insights into the factors that most influence student success

## ðŸ›  Tech Stack
- **Python 3**
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

## ðŸ“‚ Dataset
The dataset `StudentPerformanceFactors.csv` contains columns such as:
- `Parental_Education_Level`
- `Study_Hours_Per_Week`
- `Sleep_Hours_Per_Day`
- `Physical_Activity`
- `Exam_Score` *(target variable)*

*(Ensure the dataset is in the same folder as the notebook before running.)*

## ðŸš€ How to Run
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/student-score-prediction.git
   cd student-score-prediction
